Thanks for dropping by! I'm in the final year of a PhD in Applied Mathematics (a track in the [AMSC program](https://amsc.umd.edu/)) at the University of Maryland, College Park, under the supervision 
of [Prof. Antoine Mellet](https://www.math.umd.edu/~mellet/). Consequently, I'm currently on the job market, with the intention of starting a position in either summer or fall of 2025.
