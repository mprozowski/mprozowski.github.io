  Broadly, I'm interested in understanding how phenomena at ''smaller scales'' manifest at 
  ''larger scales'' in a variety of contexts, or (dually) I like problems of attempting 
  to identify ''smaller scale'' behaviors that yield a given ''larger scale'' phenomena.
  My dissertation has focused on the well-posedness and large population limits of 
  Keller-Segel-type systems with nonlinear diffusion, and (under suitable conditions) 
  the latter can be seen as sharp interface limits of some curvature-driven flows.

**Research interests:** nonlinear diffusion-aggregation equations, diffuse interface              
approximations, free boundary problems, calculus of variations, applications of optimal transport,
asymptotic analysis, and mathematical biology.
